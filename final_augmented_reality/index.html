    <h1>Final Project: Augmented Reality</h1>

        <p>In this project, we achieve augmented reality by drawing cubes on top of a box.</p>

        <p>We start by producing a video of a box that has been marked with twenty-five "keypoints". We move the camera during the video to capture the box from different camera positions and angles.</p>
        <video width="auto" height="400" controls muted>
            <source src="media/data/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <p>We manually label each keypoint in the first frame of the video.</p>
        <img src="media/out/initial_keypoints.jpg" alt="img" width="auto" height="400">

        <p>We also assign three-dimensional "world coordinates" to each keypoint. We can do this easily because the keypoints are evenly-spaced on the box.</p>
        <img src="media/out/initial_keypoints_with_coords.jpg" alt="img" width="auto" height="400">

        <p>We need to know the two-dimensional "image coordinates" of every keypoint in every frame. We already know the image coordinates of keypoints in the first frame.</p>

        <p>For each keypoint, we track the changes in the image coordinates of that keypoint with a <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d86/classcv_1_1TrackerMedianFlow.html">median flow tracker</a>. We use twenty-five trackers to determine the image coordinates of every keypoint in every frame.</p>

            <source src="media/out/tracking.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>

        <p>We now have enough information the compute the "camera projection matrix" of each frame. A camera projection matrix maps world coordinates to their corresponding image coordinates.</p>

        <p>To draw an object in a particular frame, we specify the object's world coordinates. Then we compute its image coordinates and connect them with lines. In the video below, every drawn cube has a base whose world coordinates satisfy <code>z=0</code>. As a result, every cube appears to rest on the surface of the box.</p>
