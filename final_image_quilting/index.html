    <h1>Final Project: Image Quilting</h1>

            <p>In this project, we implement the "image quilting" and "texture transfer" algorithms described in <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting.html">"Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer" (Efros, Freeman)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Randomly Sampled Textures</h2>

            <p>Texture synthesis is the creation of a similar but different version of a "texture image", or an image with repeated patterns. We begin with a highly naive approach to texture synthesis: we fill the patches of an output image by repeatedly sampling random patches from an input image.</p>

            <p class="caption">Input (from the paper)</p>
            <img src="media/random_sampling_large.png" alt="img" width="auto" height="250">
            <p class="caption">Random sampling output <code>(patch_size=15)</code></p>

            <p>The resulting output is poor because it is clearly "blocky". Note that the output (300x300) is larger than the input (192x192).</p>

        <h2>Overlapping Patches</h2>

            <p>A better approach to texture synthesis is to overlap the output patches and fill them in raster-scan order. To fill an output patch, we compute how well each input patch overlaps with the already-filled portion of the output patch. (This is measured as the SSD (sum of square differences) between the already-filled portion of the output patch and the corresponding portion of the input patch.) We set <code>tol=5</code>; in other words, one of the five best input patches is chosen at random to fill the output patch.</p>

            <p class="caption">Overlapping patches output <code>(patch_size=25, overlap=11, tol=5)</code></p>

        <h2>Seam Finding</h2>

            <p>The official image quilting algorithm eliminates "blocky" results by establishing curved boundaries between output patches. Once we have chosen an input patch to fill an output patch, we compute a curved cut along the output patch's overlapping portion. In particular, we compute the cut that minimizes the difference between existing pixels and new pixels along the path of the cut. (To do this, we compute the optimal horizontal and vertical cuts separately and combine them.)</p>

            <p class="caption">Image quilting output <code>(patch_size=25, overlap=11, tol=5)</code></p>

            <p>We display the seam-finding process for a single output patch below.</p>

        <h2>Texture Transfer</h2>

            <p>We can repurpose the image quilting algorithm to perform "texture transfer". During texture transfer, we reconstruct a guidance image by sampling patches from a different image, which we call the texture image.</p>

            <p>To produce an output that resembles the guidance image, we introduce a "correspondence cost". For any output patch and candidate input patch, the correspondence cost of choosing the input patch is the SSD between the input patch and the patch in the guidance image that is being reconstructed. (Before computing SSD, we apply several transformations to the texture and guidance images: smoothing the images, converting the images to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values.)</p>

            <p>The overall cost of selecting an input patch is the weighted average <code>alpha * overlap_cost + (1-alpha) * correspondence_cost</code> for some weight <code>alpha</code>. Note that <code>overlap_cost</code> is the existing cost that is computed from patch overlap. Once the overall cost of each input patch is known, we randomly select an input patch according to <code>tol</code> and proceed with seam-finding.</p>

        <h2>B&W: Iterative Texture Transfer</h2>
            <p>We improve texture transfer by turning it into an iterative process: we perform several raster scans with decreasing values of <code>patch_size</code> and <code>overlap</code>, and increasing values of <code>alpha</code>. Starting from the second iteration, we compute "overlap cost" using the entire input patch and all existing pixels in the output patch.</p>

            <p class="caption">Non-iterative output from before</p>
            <img src="media/transfer1_iter.png" alt="img" width="auto" height="250">
            <p class="caption">Iterative output <code>(patch_sizes=[67, 43, 27, 17, 11], overlaps=[32, 20, 12, 7, 4], tol=3, alphas=[0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])</code></p>

            <img src="media/transfer2.png" alt="img" width="auto" height="250">
            <p class="caption">Non-iterative output from before</p>

            <p>In both examples of texture transfer, the iterative outputs fix minor issues in the non-iterative outputs. In the first example, the left half of the non-iterative output contains a region of highly-uniform, "rectangular" patches; the iterative output makes these patches less uniform. In the second example, the left half of the non-iterative output has a lot of colorful noise; the iterative output somewhat dims the noise.</p>
